intro: >
    I'm a computer scientist, data scientist and developer, comfortable with a multitude of different technologies.
    I enjoy researching new ideas, implementing them into working prototypes,a s well as transferring them to practical real-world applications

buzzwords:
  - Python
  - Java
  - machine learning
  - SVM
  - SQL

additional: >
    <p><b>Java</b>: I am experienced with an array of Java APIs which are relevant to data science and machine learning, such as Weka.
    Although I feel more comfortable while developing desktop apps with Swing, I have some experience in development of web services using Jax-WS.
    During my work as researcher I also gained experience with more specific Java technologies, such as Eclipse EMF.
    Highly interested in techstack which is relevant to Big Data, Hadoop, Spark, etc. </p>
    <p><b>Web development</b>:  My server side web development experience has largely been based on development of websites
    I have used multiple CMS (Joomla, Wordpress, CMS Made Simple), as well as have some minor experience with Java frameworks (Servlets, Vaadin) <p/>
    <p><b>Best practices</b>: I gained a lot og understanding of necessity to keep code clean, simple and understandable while developing prototype tools which
    involved a considerable amount of complexity. Therefore, terms like "design patterns", "refactoring", "testing" are common for the code I write.</p>
    <p><b>Development tools</b>: I have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Junit which I find natural for everyday use</p>
