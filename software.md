**[Drag and Drop Transformations for MagicDraw UML](https://bitbucket.org/pauliusdan/magicdraw-d-d-transformations/)**  
This plug-in for MagicDraw UML provides the development environment for model-driven development of Model-to-Model (M2M) transformations 
and their processing. An important component of this tool is [M2M Transformations Core API](https://bitbucket.org/pauliusdan/transformation-framework), 
which implements all the necessary abstract M2M transformation processing and can be used to develop other similar M2M transformation solution for other compatible CASE tools. 
Such development solution enables its reuse and integration of the developed transformation engine, while at the same time providing flexibility and extendability 
essential for custom implementations. One of the core features of this approach are custom and reusable transformation libraries, developed for different modeling languages 
or their subsets, which contain model-based partial M2M transformation specifications.

**[SBVR Extraction plugin for MagicDraw UML](https://bitbucket.org/pauliusdan/sbvr-extraction/)**  
A simple MagicDraw UML case tool plugin for extracting SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules) artefacts, such as business vocabulary and business rules entries, 
from UML diagrams (currently only Use Case models and diagrams are supported). The tool is oriented to support other UML and UML profile based models in the future.  
The tool is capable to perform two types of transformations:
- Model-to-Model (M2M) - extracted elements are generated as SBVR fact model elements, using specialized SBVR profile.
- Model-to-Text (M2T) - extracted elements are represented as textual representations of SBVR business vocabulary and business rules. They can be edited using dedicated VETIS editor.

**[jswarmopt](https://github.com/paudan/jswarmopt)**  
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) implementation, aimed at extensibility and flexibility for fture research and further extensions.
